# Joomlatools Pages

### What is Joomlatools Pages?

Joomlatools Pages is an easy to use **page generator** for [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) inspired by the ideas and concepts of flat-file CMS systems like [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) and [Statamic](statamic.com), static site generators like [Jekyll]( https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and Headless CMS system like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) etc. 

Make no mistake, Pages is **not** a static site generator (SSG), Pages works in a _dynamic, lazy and smart_ way. A page is dynamically generated, cached and only re-generated when its content or layout has changed.

> Pages is more than a page generator, _it's an engine for creating websites_ 

Pages takes your Markdown files, custom HTML or PHP code churns through layouts to create a page, then injects that back into your site.  Throughout that process, you can tweak how you want the page to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

Pages has a **flat-file bias**, and **doesn't require a database** to work. The content youâ€™ll render on your site is generally written using Markdown, but you can use any kind of data source, for example you could use, a Joomla component, a database table, a headless CMS or even a webservice like [Airtable](https://airtable.com) or [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

### Why Joomlatools Pages?

For the rebuild of [Joomlatools.com](http://joomlatools.test/blog/services/introducing-our-brand-new-website) we needed a solution that would allow us to easily include, and update, content on our site. Using Joomla articles and modules would make the site very hard to manage. Pages solves this in an elegant and simple way, not to mention it's super fast and easy to work with too!

### Who is Joomlatools Pages for?

Joomlatools Pages is for website developers and designers who create bespoke Joomla sites and have experience with html, markdown, etc. If you know how to use notepad you can work with Pages, knowledge of PHP is not required to get started.
