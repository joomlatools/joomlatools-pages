## What is Joomlatools Pages?

Joomlatools Pages is a simple, static content generator for **[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org)**. It's inspired by the ideas 
and concepts of flat-file CMS systems like [Jekhyll]( https://jekyllrb.com), [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), etc. Pages takes 
your html content or renders Markdown, Twig, Joomla templates, ... spits out the result and injects it in your site.

simple way, and not to mention it's super fast too!
